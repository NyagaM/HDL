HDL has been updated to v1.3.7 (2020-07-02)
------------
*   New function `HDL.h2` is added to return the point estimate and standard error of the SNP-based heritability of one trait based on GWAS summary statistics. 
*   Please see [here](https://github.com/zhenin/HDL/wiki/Syntax-and-results-of-HDL#Estimating-heritability-using-HDL) for introducing how to use `HDL.h2`.
*   Full change log can be found [here](https://github.com/zhenin/HDL/blob/master/HDL/ChangeLog).


What is HDL?
------------

High-Definition Likelihood (HDL) is a likelihood-based method for estimating genetic correlation using GWAS summary statistics. 
Compared to [LD Score regression (LDSC)](https://github.com/bulik/ldsc), It reduces the variance of a genetic correlation estimate by about 60%. 
Here, we provide an R-based computational tool `HDL` to implement our method. Although `HDL` is written in R, 
you can use it with the command line. So no worry if you are not an R user.

In [the wiki](https://github.com/zhenin/HDL/wiki), we provide a detailed tutorial for the application of `HDL` together with real examples. 


What data are required?
-----------------------

-   `gwas1.df` and `gwas2.df`, which are two datasets including GWAS summary statistics of genetic variants for two traits. [This page](https://github.com/zhenin/HDL/wiki/Format-of-summary-statistics) describes the format of summary statistics for `HDL`, and how to perform data wrangling.

*   The eigenvalues and eigenvectors of LD matrices. For the European-ancestry population, 
we have computed the LD matrices and their eigen-decomposition from 336,000 Genomic British individuals in UK Biobank. 
You can download these pre-computed reference files following the [instruction](https://github.com/zhenin/HDL/wiki/Reference-panels) 
in the [wiki](https://github.com/zhenin/HDL/wiki).

HDL in a nut shell
-----------------------
A short presentation about the main ideas and results of HDL given at EMGM 2020 is available [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2VR1iL4l9o&list=PLnJh2XY-rMTnOdlGMEUgJfoS_Uu9Qcun0&index=6&t=0s) from 37 to 49 minutes.

For Help
--------

For direct R documentation of `HDL.rg` function, you can use a question mark in R:

``` r
?HDL.rg
```

Some bugs might have been reported and solved in the latest version of `HDL`. Therefore, please make sure your `HDL` has been updated to the latest version (see [here](https://github.com/zhenin/HDL/wiki/Installation-and-update#Updating-HDL) for how to update `HDL`).

If you have questions, you may find the [FAQ](https://github.com/zhenin/HDL/wiki/FAQ) page is helpful. If you want further discussion or still have questions, please feel free to email the maintainer of `HDL` via <zheng.ning@ki.se>.
